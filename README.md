# StreetCrimeUK_Shiny

## Introduction
The code presented here creates a shiny app to visualize heat maps of Street Crimes across Britain from 2010-12 to 2018-01 and test their spatial pattern.

## NOTE
Please not that the code here is not reproducible straight away. The app communicates with my Dropbox, though the package `rdrop2`, which requires a token to download data from Dropbox. More info [github.com/karthik/rdrop2](https://github.com/karthik/rdrop2).

I am sharing the code to potentially use a taken downloaded from elsewhere, but the `url` that points to my Dropbox will clearly not be shared.

## Preparing the dataset
